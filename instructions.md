## Pair programming

We consider working in pairs one of the most important skills in programming.
It helps clarify your thinking and keeps you from getting stuck on things
you don't understand.

###### Good pairing
- Only use one laptop
- Switch who is using the keyboard at least each time you move on to a new
  exercise
- Think outloud

## Getting Started

- Go to `www.nodejs.org` and download either v6 or v7.
- Get a text editor if you don't already have one. The following are all free
  and recommended:
  * Atom
  * Sublime Text 2
  * Visual Studio Code
- Go to `www.nodeschool.io` to look at the workshop instructions
- We recommend the following workshops:

New to javascript            | javascripting
New to Node.js               | learnyounode
Some experience with Node.js | stream-adventure

## Tips for doing the workshops

- Read all of the instructions! It's easy to miss parts
- If you want to know what's going on with your code, use
`console.log('myData', myData)`. It will first print the string `myData` to
the screen and then the value of the variable `myData`
- Test your code with `$ <name-of-workshop> run <file-name> <params>`
- Ask questions! Especially when you get to working with callbacks or modules.
Raise your hand at any time or get one of the mentor's attention. We're glad to
help :)
